        <h2>DESIGNED TO DRIVE IDEAS FORWARD</h2>
        <p>
          My career objective is to drive efficiently built quality in a 
          diverse team of engineers, designers, marketers, sales people, and 
          executives to bridge the gap between raw-idea and functioning product. 
          Iâ€™ll do this by articulating requirements, making clear decisions, removing 
          barriers, and eliciting feedback.
