## The Question That Drives Me

"Did I make the right decision" is the endlessly relevant question that drives almost all of the elements of fulfillment in our lives! The inescapable reality is that all actions, relationships, production, and goal fulfillment are directly impacted by how we answer that question and how we respond to whatever answer we may find. 

That question drives the endless - decide, act, learn -- decide, act, learn  - process that guides my life.

My personality revolves around engaging in, thinking about, and improving that one single process. 

It drives most of my communication: how did you arrive at that decision - did you consider this; what did it feel like to act in that way; how has that impacted your life? 

It drives most of my actions: did I commit to a decision; am I fulfilling my duties to that decision; am I breaking any rules of my decision? 

It drives all of my learning: how can I do it better next time; what portion of the cycle went well; how do I learn more next time?



## Me At Work:

In my work life, the cycle manifests as a desire for clarity, accountability, and improvement. And it allows me to be adaptable to most situations. I especially like cultures where teams of talented people do these sorts of things:

- They want to talk about why
- They tend to draw on diverse sources of knowledge
- They want to give and receive strong criticism
- They have the desire to coach and teach 
- They expect quality from themselves and me



## Me At Home:

I don't turn my work personality off. And continue to engage in this thinking across all my hobbies and interests. Setting goals, making plans, and trying new things is all I do, even when I'm out of the office. 

If you were to be a fly on the wall to my weekend, you'd see me:

- Woodworking, doing small projects or watching tutorials 
- Reading and writing
- Biking, fishing, hunting, or skiing



That's a bit about me! I'm looking forward to learning about you!
